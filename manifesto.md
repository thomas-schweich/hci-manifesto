The single biggest difference between projects completed in this class and projects I have completed in other classes
and my day-to-day life is that the creation of a project here keeps the farthest end goal in mind - the actual use of the program.
At times, a program I create has little need for this approach; a one-off script for smoothing some data might only be used by a couple
of scientists who don't mind typing a verbose command into their terminal, for instance. Thus, the end user has little to do with the product itself.

Or so I had always assumed. In this case, had I really thought about it, perhaps I would've seen the human element of the programs. Perhaps this human element doesn't really occur during the execution of the program itself, but in its development. Would it not be useful, even for a "one-off" script, to be able to extend it later? Why not follow a certain interface accross every such script? You could later combine them all into one. Perhaps the user is the programmer, in this instance, but I promise that programmers really are humans deep down, too. There is simply no way around it. Whether your program is written in C or is a fancy combination of whatever web tools are the fad that day (NoSQL I'm looking at you), your program is ultimately going to have to interface with humans.

While valuable, this insight is also confusing. It is hard to generalize what creating programs with the user in mind really means. A mood board is hardly useful for my smoothing script, but could be invaluable in the creation of a mobile website. Nevertheless, there are certain takeaways that apply to both.

#### Beginning with Ideation

While it is impossible to do anything without forming ideas first, the process of idation in the context of Human-Computer Interaction always seemed to follow a general pattern. The most interesting part for me was not throwing ideas at the wall, but instead the part that came immediately after: deciding who you're making the program for.

During the final project of the class, Design for Another World, my group and I were astonshed by the possibilities afforded to us by the rich world of VR. After throwing around several ideas and doing some quick research, we settled on creating a car purchase assistant. Initially, I assumed the obvious: we want to make this as enjoyable as possible for the user. While not wrong, this approach still misses something. If you're a software developer, who would you actually be designing software for in the most direct sense? Not the user, but the dealer. The dealer's interests, too, should thus be taken into account during the creation of the software.

#### Consider the Specifics
